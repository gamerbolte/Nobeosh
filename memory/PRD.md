### Feb 18, 2026 - Admin Panel Sidebar Overhaul
**Problem:** 21 flat menu items - too cluttered and hard to navigate

**Solution:** Reorganized into 7 logical collapsible groups:
1. **Main** (always visible): Dashboard, Analytics, Orders
2. **Store**: Products, Categories, Reviews
3. **Customers**: All Customers, Staff Management
4. **Marketing**: Promo Codes, Newsletter, Notification Bar

- Footer: View Store + Logout buttons

### Feb 18, 2026 - Review Carousel Fix
**Problem:** Review carousel moves too fast on mobile - users can't read reviews

**Solution:**
- Slowed down mobile animation from 80s to 120s (50% slower)
- Limited reviews to maximum 20 most recent (FIFO - new review pushes out oldest)
- Backend API now returns only 20 reviews sorted by date
- Frontend also enforces 20 limit as backup

### Feb 18, 2026 - WhatsApp Custom Fields
**Problem:** Custom form fields (like account email, game ID, etc.) not included in WhatsApp message

**Solution:**
- ProductPage now passes custom fields via URL params to PaymentPage
- Custom fields format in URL: `label:value||label:value`
- PaymentPage parses and includes in WhatsApp message
- Format in message: `*Field Label:* value`
- Also includes customer remarks/notes

**Affected Flows:**
- Single product order → WhatsApp
- Credits-paid order → WhatsApp
- Cart checkout (no custom fields, cart-based)
